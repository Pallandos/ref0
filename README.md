**Reverse Engineering From Zero** is my work on trying to get familiar with reverse engineering and binary analysis. It will be more like a note book and a collection of tools, ressources and usefull links. 

I will mostly focus on x64 architecture but i will discuss about everything.

## Table of contents

- Basics
  - [registers](/doc/basics/registers.md)
  - [formats](/doc/basics/formats.md)
  - [stack and heap](/doc/basics/stack_and_heap.md)

## Ressources

Here are some usefull ressources :

- [x64 cheatsheet](https://ref0.pallandos.dev/ressources/x64_cheatsheet.pdf)
- [x86 assembly cheatsheet](https://ref0.pallandos.dev/ressources/x86-64-reference.pdf)
- [Reverse Engineering for beginer](https://ref0.pallandos.dev/ressources/EN%20-%20Reverse%20Engineering%20for%20Beginners%20-%20Dennis%20Yurichev.pdf), by Dennis Yurichev
- [guide of x86 assembly instruction](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/)

## Tools
