**Reverse Engineering From Zero** is my work on trying to get familiar with reverse engineering and binary analysis. It will be more like a note book and a collection of tools, ressources and usefull links. 

I will mostly focus on x64 architecture but i will discuss about everything.

## Table of contents

- Basics
  - [registers](./doc/basics/registers.md)

## Ressources

Here are some usefull ressources :
